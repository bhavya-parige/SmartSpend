## 🧠 How It Works

### State Management

Redux manages the list of transactions globally, making it easy to share data across components.

### Persistence

All transactions are saved in `localStorage`, so data remains after page refresh.

### Insights

The dashboard analyzes spending and provides quick feedback, such as:

* ⚠️ High food spending
* ✅ Food spending OK
